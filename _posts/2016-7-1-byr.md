It's very-very difficult to say goodbye now.

These two weeks were incredibly informative, fun and useful. I learned how to design, programming, making games, how to use github and jekyll blogs and other lots of things. And the most impprtant one- how to communicate, work in team, help other people and be able to accept other's help.

I don't want to say that it's the last post cause I'll continue blogging.

# THANKS A LOT!
To my groupmates, Sherol Chen<3, Mr Peter, translator and assistent teachers Mr Duman and Ms Gul'mira, also teacher of another class Ms Essy, you are so cheerful, you are like sharing your smile with others, to another class, mixed activities were very interesting, to our school for organizating this marvellous course!

I wish it would be 1st day and we could start all over again. 

I'll miss all of you, especially Sherol, Essy and my new friends from other cities. 

Don't forget us Ms Sherol!

# I love you all so much!
