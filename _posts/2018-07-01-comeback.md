I've just realized it was 2 years ago when I started this blog. Many things have changed since then, though one thing will never change - I'm still into programming.
Recently I've been working hard learning data structures. I kinda understood mechanism of stacks, hashtables, maps, vectors, graphs and queues. I try to practise by solving problems on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). It's a bit challenging, but incredibly interesting.
